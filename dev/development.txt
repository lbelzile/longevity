Create functions to compute the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator described in Gampe (2010) using the EM algorithm and vanilla maximization.

Parametric models (Gompertz, exponential, generalized Pareto, extended generalized Pareto) with
X Fitting routines (left- and right-truncated, left-truncated and right-censored, no adjustment)
- Hazard plots with profile-likelihood confidence interval + confint method
- Quantile-quantile plots
- Goodness-of-fit tests (bootstrap tests)
- LR tests for difference between groups (with a binary indicator or factor variable)
- Model comparisons (Extended GP versus > Gompertz/GP > exp), including bootstrap p-values
- threshold stability plots for truncated/censored data
(via hazard?)
- Unit tests using testthat
- Vignettes
Nonparametric cumulative hazard function (with pointwise standard errors, with log-log transformations)

Northrop and Coleman model / score test for the generalized Pareto with multiple shape, adapted to deal with truncation and/or censoring
