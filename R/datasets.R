#' Dutch survival data
#'
#' This data frame contains information about all Dutch who died
#' above age 92 years between 1986 and 2015. Observations are
#' doubly truncated and such bounds are calculated based on the
#' range of plausible values for these variables.
#' There are 226 records that are interval-censored and interval-truncated
#' for which \code{bdate}, \code{ddate} and \code{ndays} is missing (\code{NA}).

#' \item{ndays}{survival time (in days)}
#' \item{bdate}{the smallest plausible birth date given information about month of birth and death and survival (in days)}
#' \item{bmonth}{month of birth}
#' \item{byear}{year of birth}
#' \item{ddate}{the largest plausible death date given information about month of birth and death and survival (in days)}
#' \item{dmonth}{month of death}
#' \item{dyear}{year of death}
#' \item{ltrunc}{minimum age (in days); the maximum of either 92 years or the number of days reached in 1986}
#' \item{rtrunc}{maximum age (in days) an individual could have reached by the end of 2015}
#' \item{gender}{factor indicating gender of individual, either \code{female} or \code{male}}
#' \item{valid}{quality flag; \code{A} for individuals born in the Netherlands, \code{B} for individuals born abroad who died in the Netherlands}

#' Japanese survival data
#'
#' This data frame contains information about the counts
#' of dead Japanese by gender and year of birth (cohort), categorized
#' by the whole part of age attained at death.
#'
#' These data were obtained from the Annual Vital Statistics Report of Japan, released by the
#' Japanese government every year since 1947. The authors note that "#' All the members of that cohort have died
#' by the end of the observation period, a procedure referred to as the
#' extinct cohort method". The data were obtained from the Human Mortality Database by the authors.

#' \item{age}{integer, age (to the smallest year) at death (in years)}
#' \item{byear}{integer, birth year}
#' \item{count}{intreger, number of death for cohort at given age}
#' \item{gender}{factor, the gender of the individuals; either \code{male} or \code{female}}
