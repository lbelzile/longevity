#' Dutch survival data
#'
#' This data frame contains information about all Dutch who died
#' above age 92 years between 1986 and 2015. Observations are
#' doubly truncated and such bounds are calculated based on the
#' range of plausible values for these variables.
#' There are 226 records that are interval-censored and interval-truncated
#' for which \code{bdate}, \code{ddate} and \code{ndays} is missing (\code{NA}).

#' England and Wales semi-supercentenarian
#'
#' This data frame contains information about 3866
#' Welsh and English who died at age ranging from 105 to 110
#' between 2000 and 2014 (except for two women
#' who died late in December 1999) and a subset of UK supercentenarians from
#' the IDL database (5 male, 80 female) who died during the same period.
#' All records for people who died at age 109 and all men,
#' plus a stratified sample of the women were validated
#' by the General Register Office (GRO). Observations are
#' doubly truncated.
#'
#' In the original data forwarded by the IDL staff,
#' there were 7 dubious records (missing birth day or month)
#' that were excluded. The referenced technical reports describes the validation
#' procedure in more details and includes (approximate) sampling weights for the validation
#' sample of women who died age 105-108.

#' Japanese survival data
#'
#' This data frame contains information about the counts
#' of dead Japanese by gender and year of birth (cohort), categorized
#' by the whole part of age attained at death.
#'
#' These data were obtained from the Annual Vital Statistics Report of Japan, released by the
#' Japanese government every year since 1947. The authors note that
#' "All the members of that cohort have died by the end of the observation period,
#' a procedure referred to as the extinct cohort method".
#' The data were obtained from the Human Mortality Database by the authors.
#' Only positive counts are reported and two records (Misao Okawa and Jiroemon Kimura) are
#' excluded because they do not correspond to the same selection mechanism.

#' Japanese survival data (2)
#'
#' This data frame is extracted from Table 10.3 from Chapter 10, "Centenarians and Supercentenarians in Japan", in the Monograph Exceptional lifespans. The data were constructed by the extinct cohort method and are stratified by age cohort (five year group, except 1899-1900) and by sex. Note that the family registry system (KOSEKI), introduced in 1872, was standardized in 1886.

#' International Database on Longevity (2021)
#'
#' This database contains data downloaded from \url{supercentenarian.org},
#' including third first waves, new data provided by ONS for semisupercentenarian,
#' data for Switzerland and Italy previously available for download and removed
#' for confidentiality. Data from Japan and from people aged less than 110 from the USA are excluded
#' because they are of dubious quality. For the USA, the semisupercentenarian records are validated,
#' but this is only a fraction of a cohort whose size is unknown and they are not representative of the whole population.
#' The birth and death dates of the USA people are unknown (only years are given,
#' so the largest plausible range is recorded given the survival in years).
#'
#' Only dead individuals are included, so the records are truncated.
#' For countries with semisupercentarians and with different collection period for
#' semisupercentenarians (105-109) and supercentenarians (110+), there
#' are some configurations leading to double interval truncation, in which case
#' data are defined in \eqn{[\code{ltrunc1}, \code{rtrunc1}] \cup [\code{ltrunc2},\code{rtrunc2}]}.
