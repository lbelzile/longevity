The `longevity` packages proposes estimation routines for modelling excess lifetime of old people. Functionalities include

Parametric models for excess lifetime (exponential, Gompertz, Weibull, generalized Pareto, extended generalized Pareto, piecewise generalized Pareto), with

- [x] maximum likelihood estimation routines
- [x] simulation of doubly truncated data
- [x] hazard plots with profile-likelihood based confidence intervals
- [x] threshold selection diagnostics with profile and Wald pointwise confidence intervals
- [x] quantile-quantile plots
- [x] likelihood ratio tests for nested models
- [x] likelihood ratio tests for a categorical explanatory
- [x] nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate of the distribution function with arbitrary truncation and censoring using the EM algorithm of Turnbull (1976).

**TODO** list:

- simulation of (left-truncated) right-censored data
- profile likelihood for generalized Pareto (shape, endpoint)
- uncertainty for diagnostic plots (via bootstrap)
- local hazard models (with associated plots)
- bootstrap *p*-values for nested models (`anova`)
- local hazard plots
- bootstrap goodness-of-fit tests
- unit tests
- vignettes

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of longevity from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("longevity") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of longevity from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lbelzile/longevity")
```

 <!-- `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->
