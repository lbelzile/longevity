<!-- badges: end -->

The `longevity` package proposes estimation routines for modeling excess lifetime. Core functionalities include maximum likelihood estimation for parametric models (exponential, Gompertz, Weibull, generalized Pareto, extended generalized Pareto, piecewise generalized Pareto), threshold selection plots for survival data, nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation, profile likelihood estimation for the endpoint of the distribution of exceedances.


## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of longevity from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("longevity") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of longevity from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lbelzile/longevity")
```

 <!-- `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->


## Current features

- [x] maximum likelihood estimation routines
- [x] simulation of left-truncated and right-truncated/right-censored data
- [x] hazard plots with profile-likelihood based confidence intervals
- [x] threshold selection diagnostics with profile and Wald pointwise confidence intervals
- [x] quantile-quantile plots
- [x] likelihood ratio tests for nested models
- [x] likelihood ratio tests for a categorical explanatory
- [] likelihood ratio tests for changepoints
- [x] score and likelihood ratio tests for piecewise generalized Pareto distribution, extending Northrop and Coleman (2014), with $p$-value paths
- [x] nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate of the distribution function with arbitrary truncation and censoring using the EM algorithm of Turnbull (1976) - C++ implementation.
- [x] profile likelihood for generalized Pareto (endpoint)
- [x] Adapt `npsurv` for interval censoring

## Improvements

- [ ] Add logistic-type models, including distributions, optimization routines, tests
- [ ] Add empirical distribution function for `npelife` and `npsurv`
- [ ] Fix `npsurv` and add weighting argument to Cpp routine.
- [ ] Remove/keep Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (depending on whether it makes sense given null distribution)
- [ ] Add plots of (local) hazards with delta-method based confidence intervals
- [ ] Change bootstrap procedure for Q-Q plots and other graphical diagnostics
- [ ] S3 methods

## Testing

- [x] Check `npsurv` for the case of 
	(1) right-censoring
	(2) left-truncation (Bell-Lynden estimator)
	(3) left-truncation and right-censoring (Tsai, Jewell and Wang)
	(4) Frydman (1994) correction for interval censored truncated data
	(5) double truncation (problem in `DTDA`?)
- [x] Check functions fail when packages listed in 'Suggests' are absent
- [x] Check that all ANOVA nesting works as expected (with null distribution)
- [ ] Fix starting values for `gomp` and `gompmake` and make sure model is as good as submodel
- [ ] Verify fitting procedure in multiple instances, including interval censoring, left and right truncation, etc.
- [ ] Check all plots type are produced with both base **R** and `ggplot2`

## Package on CRAN

- [ ] Add tests and examples for each function
- [ ] Add vignettes
- [x] Use `pkgdown` to create a webpage
- [ ] Root out data sets that cannot go on CRAN (with accompanying examples)
- [ ] Submit to the CRAN
